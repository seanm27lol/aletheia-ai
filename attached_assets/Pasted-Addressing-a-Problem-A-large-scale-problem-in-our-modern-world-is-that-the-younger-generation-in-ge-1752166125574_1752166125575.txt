Addressing a Problem:
A large-scale problem in our modern world is that the younger generation in general doesn’t read the paper or have subscriptions to news apps like CNN, FOX, NBC etc. Many rely on online social media platforms like Instagram or Tiktok for their news which come in short form content. Unlike our youth’s parents and grandparent’s generations, their brains aren’t wired or inclined to consume traditional news media like the paper or primetime news stories. This is evident in the nation’s youth’s heavy reliance on social media for news specifically during the 2024 election. But unfortunately, misinformation permeates the social media space and many young people consume content that contains false information and/or heavy biases from users that do not have verified information and/or expertise to correctly assess incoming news stories. An incorrectly informed youth creates a dangerous future, yet many media companies, although establishing their own short term social media content on social media sites, haven’t fully jumped into the short term content zone to mass produce their media. This has shown some detrimental effects to viewership of well-established media companies as their traditional viewer base, whom grew up consuming their media, gets older and the younger generation starts to become the primary consumption of news. 
Think about the many prevalent media companies like CNN and MSNBC whose revenueand viewership has significantly decreased from prior years. From 2021 to 2023 CNN’s has lost over 400 million in revenue. In recent years CNN's prime-time audience has dropped by 47% and MSNBC's by 53%. People don’t watch the news as much as they used to and our younger generation’s content preference isn’t improving this problem.
